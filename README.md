Here I've **listed over 100 Linux commands**. There are even more commands if we include downloadable software and scripts, such as  [btop](https://linuxblog.io/btop-the-htop-alternative/)  (pictured below). I use glances and also it provide the support for the better visualization of the sandboxes when i am forking the docker and inspecting the same. ``` brew install glances ``` and with kubernetes it works great as minimal window and application view.

However, we will only cover Unix commands used on Linux by sysadmins and power users.
